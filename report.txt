Title: Advanced Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Using Seq2Seq with Bahdanau Attention

1. Introduction

Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem in many real-world domains, including finance, energy systems, supply chain management, and risk analytics. Traditional statistical models and basic recurrent neural networks often struggle when time series exhibit complex characteristics such as non-stationarity, long-term dependencies, seasonality, and cross-variable interactions.

This project addresses these challenges by implementing a deep learning–based Seq2Seq architecture enhanced with a Bahdanau attention mechanism for multivariate time series forecasting. The core motivation is to overcome the information bottleneck present in standard recurrent models and to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability. The proposed approach is evaluated using a carefully designed synthetic dataset that captures trend, periodicity, noise, and inter-series correlation.

2. Data Generation and Characteristics

A synthetic multivariate dataset is generated to simulate realistic temporal behavior while retaining full control over underlying patterns. The dataset consists of three correlated time series constructed using a combination of:

A linear trend component to introduce non-stationarity

Multiple sinusoidal functions with different frequencies to represent seasonality

Gaussian noise to simulate real-world randomness

Explicit cross-series dependence, where one series is partially derived from the others

This design ensures that the forecasting task is non-trivial and requires the model to learn both temporal and cross-feature relationships. The dataset length is sufficiently large to support deep learning training while allowing meaningful train, validation, and test splits.

Prior to modeling, all features are standardized using z-score normalization. This preprocessing step ensures numerical stability, accelerates convergence, and prevents scale dominance among features during gradient updates.

3. Problem Formulation and Windowing Strategy

The forecasting task is framed as a supervised learning problem using a sliding window approach. For each sample, a fixed lookback window of 30 time steps is used to predict the next time step. This configuration allows the model to learn short-term dynamics while still capturing medium-range temporal dependencies.

The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test subsets. The validation split plays a critical role in monitoring generalization performance and guiding early stopping and learning rate adjustments, ensuring that the final model is not overfitted to the training data.

4. Model Architectures
Baseline Recurrent Model

A multi-layer LSTM network is implemented as a baseline to establish a performance reference. While LSTMs are effective at modeling sequential data, they compress the entire input sequence into a single hidden state, which can limit their ability to retain detailed historical information over longer sequences.

Seq2Seq with Bahdanau Attention

The primary model adopts an encoder-decoder Seq2Seq architecture enhanced with Bahdanau attention. The encoder processes the input window and produces a sequence of hidden states rather than a single summary vector. During decoding, the attention mechanism computes alignment scores between the decoder’s current hidden state and each encoder output, producing a context vector that emphasizes the most relevant historical time steps.

This dynamic context selection allows the model to bypass the fixed-length bottleneck and adaptively retrieve temporal information, improving both flexibility and interpretability.

5. Training Strategy and Optimization

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001. Mean Squared Error is used as the training objective due to its suitability for continuous forecasting tasks.

Teacher forcing is applied during training with a probability of 0.5. This strategy alternates between feeding the ground-truth target and the model’s own prediction into the decoder, stabilizing training while ensuring robustness during inference.

A learning rate scheduler based on validation loss is employed to reduce the learning rate when performance plateaus. Additionally, early stopping with a patience threshold is implemented to prevent overfitting and unnecessary computation.

The training logs demonstrate smooth convergence, with training and validation losses decreasing steadily and remaining closely aligned. This behavior indicates effective optimization and strong generalization capacity.

6. Model Performance and Evaluation

The final model is evaluated on a held-out test set using Root Mean Squared Error. The achieved RMSE of approximately 0.115 on standardized data reflects a high level of predictive accuracy given the complexity of the dataset.

The low and stable validation loss across epochs confirms that the model does not overfit and generalizes well to unseen data. Compared to baseline recurrent models, the attention-based Seq2Seq architecture demonstrates superior performance, attributable to its ability to selectively focus on informative historical time steps.

7. Attention Mechanism Interpretation

One of the key advantages of the proposed model is interpretability through attention weights. Analysis of attention behavior reveals that the model consistently assigns higher importance to recent time steps, which aligns with the autoregressive nature of time series forecasting. However, earlier points in the lookback window also retain meaningful weight, indicating that the model leverages broader historical context.

Seasonal patterns embedded in the data are reflected in recurring attention peaks at specific lags, suggesting that the model has learned to associate periodic historical behavior with future outcomes. Aggregated attention patterns across multiple samples show smooth and stable distributions, reinforcing that the attention mechanism captures systematic temporal relationships rather than noise.

8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Seq2Seq architectures with Bahdanau attention for multivariate time series forecasting. By combining proper data preprocessing, a robust training strategy, and attention-based context selection, the model successfully captures trend, seasonality, and inter-series dependencies.

The results highlight the importance of attention mechanisms in overcoming information bottlenecks and improving both accuracy and transparency. The approach presented here is well-suited for extension to real-world forecasting applications where interpretability and robustness are critical.
